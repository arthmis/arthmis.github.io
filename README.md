## This is a personal website and blog 

### Building

You will need [`zola`](https://www.getzola.org/) to build this project.

After downloading zola you can build the site with

```
zola build
```
from the root of the directory or you can build and start a local server for the website with

```
zola serve
```

After serving you can find the website at [`localhost:1111`](localhost:1111) on your web browser which is the default port used.
